## Task: Sales Prediction Using Python

## Objective

Predict product sales based on advertising expenditure using machine learning techniques in Python. This task focuses on analyzing the relationship between different advertising platforms and sales to help businesses make data-driven marketing decisions.

## Dataset

Advertising Dataset (Public):  
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ashydv/advertising-dataset

The dataset contains advertising budgets and corresponding sales values.

## Features:
- TV – Advertising budget spent on TV
- Radio – Advertising budget spent on Radio
- Newspaper – Advertising budget spent on Newspaper

## Target:
- Sales – Product sales

## Tools Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn


## Model Used
**Linear Regression**
- Simple and effective regression algorithm
- Suitable for predicting continuous numerical values
- Helps interpret the relationship between advertising spend and sales


## Workflow
- Import required libraries
- Load and explore the dataset
- Perform data preprocessing
- Split data into training and testing sets
- Train Linear Regression model
- Evaluate model performance


## Evaluation Metrics
- R² Score
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)


## Conclusion

A Linear Regression model was successfully implemented to predict sales based on advertising expenditure. The results demonstrate how advertising investments influence sales and highlight the effectiveness of machine learning in sales forecasting.
