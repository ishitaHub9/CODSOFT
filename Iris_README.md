## Task: Iris Flower Classification

### Objective
To build a machine learning model that can classify Iris flowers into three species — Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica — based on their sepal and petal measurements.

### Dataset
- Iris Flower Dataset
- Features:
  - Sepal Length
  - Sepal Width
  - Petal Length
  - Petal Width
- Target:
  - Species

### Model Used
- Logistic Regression  
- Chosen for its simplicity and effectiveness in multi-class classification problems.

### Workflow
1. Data loading and exploration
2. Data preprocessing and label encoding
3. Train-test split (80% training, 20% testing)
4. Model training
5. Model evaluation

### Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy Score
- Confusion Matrix
- Classification Report


### Outcome
The model successfully classified Iris flower species with high accuracy, demonstrating a complete machine learning classification workflow.
