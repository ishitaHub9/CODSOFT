## Task: Iris Flower Classification

### Objective
To build a machine learning model that can classify Iris flowers into three species — Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica — based on their sepal and petal measurements.

### Dataset

Iris Flower Dataset (Public):  
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/iris

The dataset contains measurements of iris flowers categorized into three species.


### Features:
- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width

### Target:
- Species

### Tools Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

### Model Used
- Logistic Regression  
- Chosen for its simplicity and effectiveness in multi-class classification problems.

### Workflow
1. Data loading and exploration
2. Data preprocessing and label encoding
3. Train-test split (80% training, 20% testing)
4. Model training
5. Model evaluation

### Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy Score
- Confusion Matrix
- Classification Report


### Outcome
The model successfully classified Iris flower species with high accuracy, demonstrating a complete machine learning classification workflow.
